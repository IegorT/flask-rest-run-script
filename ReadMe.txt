For better organizing the main part of Flask application were splitted into 3 parts: view,
controllers and scripts that need to run. All of this parts present in app folder.
view.py - for rendering html-file, accepting requests and rendering response(in JSON format)
controller.py - for finding and calling scripts
scripts - the folder for script



The server start => "python run.py"
